Asymmetric Behavioral Consequences from Different Component Orders in Verbal Action-Effect Instructions

# Analysis approach (central hypothesis)
We will perform Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) to assess the relationship between our experimental factors and the dependent variables (response errors and response times).
Our hypotheses (see Hypothesis section) are reflected in a 4-way interaction effect between Sentence-response (left vs. right), Required-response (left vs. right), Effect-prime (present vs. absent), and Sentence-component (effect-action vs. action-effect). The 2-way interaction effect between Sentence-response (left vs. right) and Required-response (left vs. right) represents the central response-priming/compatibility effect (fewer errors/quicker responses in “left”/”left” and “right/right” trial combinations as compared to “left”/”right” and “right”/”left” combinations). This priming/compatibility effect (2-way interaction) should be more substantial in the Effect-prime “present” condition than in the Effect-prime “absent” condition (i.e., 3-way interaction effect). Finally, the central hypothesis is reflected in this 3-way interaction effect being more substantial in the Sentence-component “effect-action” condition than in the “action-effect” condition. (For simplicity purposes, we may collapse some factors [e.g., Sentence-response and Required-response] to create a compatibility score for the analyses and graphical representation.)

# Pre-registration of data treatment
- Participants showing random responses (~50% errors and above) will be removed. 
- Participants that are "extrem" outliers (boxplot, 3*IQR) on mean response times or mean error rate will be removed.
- Participants having more than 10% of responses below 300 ms will be removed.
(Response time analyses only)
- For response time analyses, response errors will be removed.
- Response times below 150 ms will be excluded from the analysis.
- Individual response times that are beyond 3*SD above/below the mean (calculated per participant and within participant condition) will be removed.
